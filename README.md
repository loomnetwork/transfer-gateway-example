# Cards Gateway Example

This project is built using the [loom-js][] Transfer Gateway API, and demonstrates how to transfer
ERC721 tokens between Ethereum and Loom DAppChains via a browser frontend built with React.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

* node >= 8
* wget (used to download Loom DAppChain binary)
* nc (used to check required ports aren't in use)
* [MetaMask][] browser extension

### Install

After cloning this repository install all the necessary dependencies use the `transfer_gateway`
shell script to automatically download & install all the required dependencies:

```bash
./transfer_gateway setup
```

### Running

After everything has been installed use the `transfer_gateway` script to spin up all the required
services:

```bash
./transfer_gateway start
```

### Stop

When you're done playing around with the example you should stop all the running services using:

```bash
./transfer_gateway stop
```

### Status

To check which services are currently running:

```bash
./transfer_gateway status
```

### Cleanup

If you want to start with a clean slate you can remove all the `node_modules` directories, and the
loom binary by running:

```bash
./transfer_gateway cleanup
```

### Web Browser

After `./transfer_gateway start` and starts the necessary services you can access the web frontend
at `localhost:8080`.

### MetaMask

This example requires [MetaMask][] to be installed, you must also set MetaMask to use the
`Private Network` at `localhost:8545`.

You will also need to [import the private key](https://consensys.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004176551-Importing-Accounts-New-UI-) `0xbb63b692f9d8f21f0b978b596dc2b8611899f053d68aec6c1c20d1df4f5b6ee2` generated by Ganache (account `0x5194b63f10691e46635b27925100cfc0a5ceca62`) into MetaMask.

#### Troubleshooting

If you stop the example and start it up again you may encounter a MetaMask error like this:
> "rpc error with payload {…nonce. account has nonce of: 0 tx has nonce of: 5"

This happens because MetaMask keeps track of the last nonce that was used to send a transaction with
a particular account, and when all the chains are reset the nonce needs to be reset back to zero.
You can force MetaMask to reset the nonce by [reseting the imported account](https://consensys.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004177531-Resetting-an-Account-New-UI-).


## Example "in a nutshell"

The `cards-gateway-example` directory contains five sub directories:

```bash
├── dappchain
├── truffle-ethereum
├── truffle-dappchain
├── transfer-gateway-scripts
└── webclient
```

In the following sections we'll explain what's in each of these directories.

> NOTE: In this doc we use the term Mainnet to refer to an Ethereum-like network, as a matter of
> convenience. In this example the only Ethereum network we actually interact with is Ganache, but
> you could also hook everything up to use the Ethereum Mainnet, or the Rinkeby Testnet by changing
> a few configuration settings.

### 📁 dappchain

This directory contains the `loom` binary (after setup), DAppChain config files, and some key pairs.

> The keys have been generated specifically for this example, don't reuse them anywhere else.
> If you wish to use this project as a starting point for your own please don't forget to replace
> all the keys with your own.

Let's take a closer look at `loom.yaml`, this is a configuration file that can be used to configure
both the DAppChain node and the Transfer Gateway Oracle. You can find documentation on the various
settings in this config file in the [Loom SDK docs](https://loomx.io/developers/docs/en/loom-yaml.html),
but we'll highlight some of the settings here that are relevant to this example.

#### loom.yaml

```yaml
# This is a unique identifier for the DAppChain used in this example
ChainID: "default"
# This enables the latest version of the contract registry maintained by the DAppChain, which is
# required in order for the Transfer Gateway to be able verify DAppChain contract ownership.
# This setting must not be changed after the DAppChain starts for the first time!
RegistryVersion: 2
# Transfer Gateway Settings
TransferGateway:
  # Enables the Gateway Go contract (DAppChain Gateway), must be the same on all nodes.
  ContractEnabled: true
  
  # Enables the in-process Gateway Oracle.
  OracleEnabled: true

  # Address of the Ganache network where the Mainnet Solidity contracts are deployed
  # (take a look at the truffle-ethereum directory).
  EthereumURI: "http://127.0.0.1:8545"

  # Address of the Mainnet Gateway contract deployed to the Ganache network above.
  MainnetContractHexAddress: "0xf5cad0db6415a71a5bc67403c87b56b629b4ddaa"

  # Private key that will be used by the Gateway Oracle to sign pending withdrawals.
  MainnetPrivateKeyPath: "oracle_eth_priv.key"

  # Private key that will be used by the Gateway Oracle to send txs to the DAppChain Gateway.
  DAppChainPrivateKeyPath: "oracle_priv.key"

  # Address of DAppChain node the Gateway Oracle should interact with.
  DAppChainReadURI: "http://localhost:46658/query"
  DAppChainWriteURI: "http://localhost:46658/rpc"

  # These control how frequently the Gateway Oracle will poll the DAppChain and Ganache.
  DAppChainPollInterval: 1 # seconds
  MainnetPollInterval: 1 # seconds

  # Number of seconds to wait before starting the Gateway Oracle, this allows the DAppChain node
  # to spin up before the Gateway Oracle tries to connect to it.
  OracleStartupDelay: 5
  
  # Number of seconds the Gateway Oracle should wait between reconnection attempts if it encounters
  # a network error of some kind.
  OracleReconnectInterval: 5
```

Now let's take a look at the `genesis.json` file (or `genesis.example.json` if you haven't setup the
example yet), this file specifies which Go contracts should be deployed to the DAppChain when the
DAppChain starts up for the first time. You can read more about the `coin` and `dpos` contracts in the
[Built-in Contracts docs][], but these two contracts are not relevant to this particular example.
The two contracts we're interested in are the built-in `addressmapper`, and `gateway` contracts.

#### genesis.json

```javascript
{
    "contracts": [
        {
            "vm": "plugin",
            "format": "plugin",
            "name": "addressmapper",
            "location": "addressmapper:0.1.0",
            "init": null
        },
        {
            "vm": "plugin",
            "format": "plugin",
            "name": "gateway",
            "location": "gateway:0.1.0",
            "init": {
                // Address of the Gateway Owner, only the owner can change the set of Gateway
                // Oracles the contract is allowed to interact with.
                "owner": {
                    "chain_id": "default",
                    "local": "c/IFoEFkm4+D3wdqLmFU9F3t3Sk="
                },
                // Initial set of Gateway Oracles that the contract will be allowed to interact with,
                // identified by their address.
                "oracles": [
                    {
                        "chain_id": "default",
                        "local": "22nuyPPZ53/qAqFnhwD2EpNu9ss="
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The Address Mapper contract is responsible for mapping owned DAppChain accounts to Mainnet accounts,
and vice versa, you can read more about its purpose in the [Transfer Gateway docs][].

The Gateway contract is responsible for contract mapping, and token transfers to and from the
DAppChain. It relies on the Gateway Oracle (though there may be more than one) to transfer relevant
data between the DAppChain and Mainnet.

### 📁 truffle-ethereum

This directory contains the contracts that will be deployed on the Ethereum network, the `Gateway` and `CryptoCards` the ERC721 token representation on the Ethereum network.

The act of depositing `CryptoCards` on `Gateway` is the one of the main features on this ERC721 token, let's look on the function.

```sol
function depositToGateway(uint tokenId) public {
  safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, gateway, tokenId);
}
```

This function once called along with the `tokenId` will also call the `safeTransferFrom` which will call the function `onERC721Received` on contract `Gateway` which will register the owner of the token.

Another important function is the `withdrawERC721` on `Gateway`, called once the user wants to withdraw the token from `DAppChain` and get back the fully ownership of the token.

> The withdraw process only happen with a secure sign guaranteed by the validators of the network, no one unless the owner of the token can withdraw from DAppChain

### 📁 truffle-dappchain

This directory contains the `CryptoCardsDAppChain` ERC721 contract that's deployed to the DAppChain,
this contract will keep track of any tokens sent from the `CryptoCards` ERC721 contract on Mainnet
to the DAppChain via the Transfer Gateway.

When a user deposits their `CryptoCards` tokens into the Mainnet Gateway contract the DAppChain
Gateway contract will `mint` the corresponding tokens in the `CryptoCardsDAppChain` contract.

Note that the DAppChain Gateway must be authorized to mint tokens in the `CryptoCardsDAppChain`
contract, otherwise token transfers from Mainnet to the DAppChain won't work.

```solidity
function mint(uint256 _uid) public {
  require(msg.sender == gateway);
  _mint(gateway, _uid);
}
```

### 📁 transfer-gateway-scripts

This directory contains a single `index.js` script file which is responsible for mapping the
`CryptoCards` ERC721 contract on Mainnet to the `CryptoCardsDAppChain` ERC721 contract on the
DAppChain. Without this contract mapping the Transfer Gateway won't know what to do when it receives
ERC721 tokens from either contract. You can read more about contract mapping in the
[Transfer Gateway docs][].

### 📁 webclient

This directory contain the web frontend, which requires `MetaMask` to be installed in a compatible
browser (Chrome / Firefox). The web frontend can be reached at `http://localhost:8080` after running
the `./transfer_gateway start`.

The frontend consists of four pages:
- `Home` - where you must map your Mainnet account to a DAppChain account by signing a message via
          `MetaMask` with your Mainnet account. This must be done before attempting to transfer
           any cards.
- `Owned Cards` - where you can see the cards currently owned by you on Mainnet (yeah we just
                      gave 5 cards to you 😉).
- `Cards on Gateway` - where you can see the cards in the Mainnet Gateway that are waiting to be
                      withdrawn by you to your Mainnet account.
- `Cards on DAppChain` - where you can see the cards that have been transfered to the DAppChain from
                        your Mainnet account.
